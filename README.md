# Iterative-methods-linear-equations

Overview
This repository contains a Python program that solves linear equations using three iterative methods: Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR). These methods are widely used for solving systems of linear equations, particularly when dealing with large, sparse matrices where direct methods like Gaussian elimination are computationally expensive.

Features
Jacobi Method: An iterative algorithm that solves each equation for a single variable and then uses these new values in the next iteration.
Gauss-Seidel Method: An improvement over the Jacobi method, it uses the latest available values for all variables.
Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) Method: An extension of the Gauss-Seidel method that accelerates the convergence by introducing a relaxation factor.
